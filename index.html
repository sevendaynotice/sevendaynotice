        <h3>Partial Abatement</h3>
        <p>One-third of the daily rent can be deducted for each day that the issue remains unresolved after notice.</p>
        <h3>Full Abatement</h3>
        <p>If the unit is uninhabitable and the tenant must vacate, they may withhold all rent until repairs are made.</p>
